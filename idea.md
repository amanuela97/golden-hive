Core Business Idea

Right now, honey produced in villages goes through many middlemen before reaching the final consumer/retailer.

Your friend wants to digitize the supply chain so that:

Local producers sell directly to consumers or retailers.

Producers earn more.

Consumers get authentic honey at better prices.

The system tracks demand/supply and supports data-driven forecasting.

Phase 1 (Testing the Idea)

Start small with two types of honey:

Domestic bee honey (regular natural honey).

Wild bee honey / “Mad Honey” (a unique product from Nepal with high demand internationally).

Build a website platform that:

Showcases honey products.

Allows customers (retailers or direct consumers) to order online.

Supports payments (likely international payments too).

Acts as a marketplace connecting local producers ↔ buyers.

Phase 2 (Expansion Plan)

If the honey project works, expand to other sectors/products.

Scale into something like Wolt or other MLOPs (Multi-Level Online Platforms):

Helping different businesses digitalize their services.

Eventually using AI and data for automation, forecasting, and optimization.

What He Wants from You (the Website)

A modern, user-friendly website for testing the honey business:

Product catalog: photos, descriptions (e.g., domestic honey, mad honey).

E-commerce features: shopping cart, checkout, order tracking.

Producer profiles: highlight local farmers to build trust.

Payment system: easy and secure (maybe Stripe, PayPal, or local integrations).

Data collection: demand, supply, and sales info for future analytics.

Scalable design: so later it can expand beyond honey to other products/services.
