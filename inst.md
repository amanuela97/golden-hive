- Write the functionalities with performant logic for my /cart and /checkout pages.
- Customers can browse the /products page and when they hover over a product card there should appear a small "add to cart" button.
- when the "add to cart" button is clicked, the item is added to the cart list (if clicked multiple times then the amount is incremented).
- There should be a cart icon that displays the number of items added, and the total price in euros on the right side of the navbar.
- The customer can also navigate to /products/id page and increment the quantity and click the add to cart button which already exists but is not functional.
- The cart items should be persisted to local storage incase the page is reloaded.
- The SettingsModal should be available in the customer, seller and also admins dashboards
- from the SettingsModal there should be a tab for saving shipping/billing information into the db (create drizzle schema fro storing info if it does not exist in schema.ts)
- in the /checkout page if the customer is a signed user then you can populate the billing information form. otherwise they have to sign in if they have an account or then just proceed to fill the form.
