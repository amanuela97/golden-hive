Left column (thumbnail rail)

Center column (main image viewer)

The gallery is desktop-first, clean, minimal, and content-focused.

“Create a product image gallery similar to Etsy’s product page. The layout has a vertical column of small square thumbnails on the left and a large square main image on the right. Clicking a thumbnail updates the main image. The main image has left and right navigation arrows centered vertically inside the image container. Styling is minimal, clean, and neutral with subtle borders and spacing. No heavy animations, no zoom by default, and the design feels like a professional marketplace UI.”
