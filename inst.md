- in InventoryPageClient add a price column which can be fetched from the listing_variant column in invetory_items table.
- in InventoryPageClient add a tooltip with the following text info for the following table columns;
  - available = Units at a specific location that are free to sell right now (value can be set using input field or an increment/decrement arrow buttons inside input).
  - committed = Units that are reserved for an order but not yet fulfilled. (not an editable field for now)
  - incoming = Units that are on the way to the location, but not yet received (value can be set using input field or an increment/decrement arrow buttons inside input).
  - Cost per item = the total expense to produce, acquire, or deliver a single product (display with the correct currency which is found in the listing_variant table).
  - Price = price of the variant item/product. (needs to be added to the table, display with correct currency)
  - On hand = the sum of available, committed, and incoming.(needs to be added to the table)
- add a dotted black bottom border to each one of those columns above and add cursor pointer to indicate they have a small tooltip when you hover over the text.
- currently when you edit the editable input values in the inventory table they are automatically saved to db you should instead display a div with a text "Unsaved changes" and buttons "discard" and "save" above the table when an input value is modified. if pressed save then save it to the db other wise just reset it.
- additionally display each Inventory value in the table with the correct currency for that specific listing_variant but for the total inventory value of the page displayed at the top add a dropdown select above the table to select the currency in which to calculate and display it in.
- also make sure the logic for saving those values is effecient and only updates the table columns that were changed
