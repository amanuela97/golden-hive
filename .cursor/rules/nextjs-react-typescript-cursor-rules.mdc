You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Create custom components in /app/components folder.
- Always use Shadcn ui components from /components/ui folder.
  Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- When defining types for table make sure to use the types from the schema.ts so when the fields change in the database it automatically updates in the code.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Follow styles defined in design-system.md.
- Use gsap for animation.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Use caching and revalidation for fetch calls in server components:
  - cache: "force-cache" for static content
  - next: { revalidate: N } for ISR
- Use the `use` hook for async data in server components where appropriate.
- Use `useOptimistic` for optimistic UI updates.
- Use `useFormAction` / Server Actions for form submissions in App Router.
- Stream server component content when fetching large datasets to improve LCP.
- Favor Edge runtime for low-latency global API routes or static data.

Key Conventions

- Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components over api routes and Next.js ISR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
- Wrap client components that fetch data with Suspense + fallback to optimize perceived performance.
- Apply caching, streaming, or optimistic updates automatically where they improve UX or performance.
