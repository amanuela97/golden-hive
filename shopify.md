## CUSTOMER

Customers in Shopify are automatically created when someone places an order, signs up for your mailing list, creates an account, or even abandons their checkout. Each customer profile stores valuable information including contact details, shipping addresses, purchase history, marketing preferences, and tax exemption status.

You can manage all your customers from the Customers page, where you can view profiles, send individual emails, or group customers with similar characteristics into segments for more targeted communication. Customer profiles help you build stronger relationships by personalizing the shopping experience and keeping accurate records for marketing and sales purposes.

You can also add custom information to customer profiles using metafields for specialized data like birthdays or loyalty program status, and use tags to organize customers for easy filtering and searching.

# ORDERS

Orders in Shopify represent customer purchases from your store and appear on the Orders page when someone buys from your online store or any sales channel. When you receive an order, you can manage it through various tasks including processing payment, fulfilling items, editing order details, issuing refunds, or handling returns and exchanges.

Orders have different statuses to help you track their progress: Open orders need work like payment processing or fulfillment, Archived orders are complete, and Canceled orders have been stopped. Payment statuses range from Pending and Authorized to Paid or Refunded, while fulfillment statuses show whether items have been shipped to customers. You can filter and organize orders using custom views based on these statuses, location, or shipping method to quickly find orders that need attention.

The fulfillment process involves preparing, packaging, and shipping items to customers, which you can handle yourself individually or in bulk, or outsource to third-party fulfillment services. You can also buy and print shipping labels directly from your Shopify admin to streamline the process.
